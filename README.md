# üöÄ Static Website Deployment to AWS S3

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the deployment of a static website to an AWS S3 bucket. It also outlines how to provision the necessary AWS infrastructure using **Terraform** and integrate with **Argo CD** for a comprehensive GitOps approach.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AWS Setup
1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
   - Bucket Name: `staticwebsitetarcin`
   - Region: `us-east-1`
   - Enable static website hosting.
   
2. **Set Bucket Policy**
Ensure the following policy is attached to allow public read access:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::staticwebsitetarcin/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. **Create IAM User**
   - Assign programmatic access.
   - Attach policies to allow full S3 access for the specific bucket. A policy like the following grants necessary permissions:
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": [
                     "s3:PutObject",
                     "s3:GetObject",
                     "s3:ListBucket",
                     "s3:DeleteObject"
                 ],
                 "Resource": [
                     "arn:aws:s3:::staticwebsitetarcin",
                     "arn:aws:s3:::staticwebsitetarcin/*"
                 ]
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

4. **Configure GitHub Secrets**
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key.
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project supports a comprehensive deployment strategy, encompassing both infrastructure provisioning and continuous application delivery.

### üì¶ Application Deployment (GitHub Actions to S3)

The static website files are automatically deployed to the configured AWS S3 bucket using GitHub Actions. This workflow ensures that any changes pushed to the `main` branch are reflected on your website.

#### GitHub Action Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
```yaml
name: Deploy to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Deploy to S3
        run: |
          aws s3 sync . s3://staticwebsitetarcin --delete
```

#### How to Trigger Deployment:
1. Commit your changes to your local repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update website content"
   ```
2. Push your changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
3. The GitHub Action will automatically run, synchronize the updated files to the S3 bucket, and delete any files from S3 that are no longer present in your repository.

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)

The AWS S3 bucket and its associated configurations (like static website hosting and bucket policy) can be provisioned and managed using Terraform. This Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach ensures that your infrastructure is version-controlled, repeatable, and consistent across environments.

#### Terraform Files (example structure):
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf             # Defines AWS provider and S3 bucket
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf        # Input variables for configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf          # Output values like bucket ARN or website endpoint
```

#### Example `terraform/main.tf`:
```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Or your desired region, e.g., var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "static_website_bucket" {
  bucket = "staticwebsitetarcin" # Ensure this matches your desired bucket name

  # Enable static website hosting
  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html" # Optional, define an error.html in your content
  }

  tags = {
    Project = "StaticWebsite"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

# Attach bucket policy for public read access (recommended over public-read ACLs)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "public_read_policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.static_website_bucket.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "${aws_s3_bucket.static_website_bucket.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

output "website_endpoint" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.static_website_bucket.website_endpoint
  description = "The S3 website endpoint."
}

output "website_domain" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.static_website_bucket.website_domain
  description = "The S3 website domain."
}
```

#### How to Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform:
1. Navigate to the `terraform/` directory in your terminal.
2. Initialize Terraform (downloads providers and modules):
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. Plan the infrastructure changes (shows what Terraform will do):
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
4. Apply the changes to provision your AWS S3 bucket:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   Confirm with `yes` when prompted.

### üîÅ Continuous Delivery with Argo CD (GitOps for Kubernetes-Managed Infrastructure)

For advanced GitOps-driven continuous delivery in environments utilizing Kubernetes, this project can be integrated with Argo CD. While Argo CD primarily manages application deployments to Kubernetes clusters, it can orchestrate the deployment of related infrastructure components or even trigger S3 deployments indirectly through Kubernetes Jobs or custom operators, thereby extending GitOps principles to your S3-hosted static website.

This would typically involve:

1.  **Terraform Automation via Kubernetes**: Using Argo CD to manage Kubernetes resources that, in turn, automate Terraform runs (e.g., using a Terraform Operator for Kubernetes like Crossplane, or custom Kubernetes Jobs) to provision and manage the S3 bucket's lifecycle.
2.  **S3 Content Synchronization via Kubernetes Job**: Configuring Argo CD to deploy a Kubernetes Job which, upon creation or modification, executes the `aws s3 sync` command. This Job would pull the latest website content from a source repository (e.g., this repository) and push it to the designated S3 bucket.
3.  **Custom S3 Operator (Advanced)**: For more complex scenarios, a custom Kubernetes operator could be developed. Argo CD would manage Custom Resources (CRs) for this operator, and the operator would then translate these CRs into direct S3 operations (like content synchronization or bucket policy management).

This setup enables a fully GitOps approach where both infrastructure (S3 bucket) and application deployment (website content) are declared in Git and continuously synchronized by Argo CD, offering high visibility, auditability, and automated reconciliation of the desired state.

#### Key Concepts for Argo CD Integration:
-   **Git as Single Source of Truth**: All desired states (infrastructure and application configurations) are defined and version-controlled in Git.
-   **Automated Sync**: Argo CD continuously monitors the Git repository for changes and automatically applies them to the target environment.
-   **Self-Healing**: Argo CD detects and remediates any divergence from the desired state, ensuring your environment always matches what's declared in Git.

## üß© Troubleshooting
-   **Access Denied**: Ensure the IAM user has the correct permissions (as described in AWS Setup, step 3) and that the S3 bucket policy allows public read access (AWS Setup, step 2).
-   **ACL Errors**: Ensure that your S3 bucket's "Object Ownership" is set to "Bucket owner enforced" (which disables ACLs) and rely solely on bucket policies for access control, as ACLs are generally discouraged for new buckets and can lead to permission complexities.
-   **Website Not Loading**: Verify that static website hosting is enabled on the S3 bucket and that the `index.html` file (or your specified index document) exists at the root of your bucket.
