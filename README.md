# Non-Disruptive Customer Feedback Solution

This solution provides a way for users to submit feedback without altering your existing website UI or disrupting their browsing experience. It works by having a small, invisible JavaScript listener that only reveals a feedback widget when a specific trigger (e.g., a keyboard shortcut or a special URL parameter) is activated by the user.

## How It Works

1.  **Invisible Listener (`feedback-integrator.js`):** A small JavaScript file is included on every page. It doesn't render any visible UI elements initially. Its sole purpose is to listen for predefined triggers.
2.  **Dynamic Widget Loading:** When a trigger is detected, the `feedback-integrator.js` script dynamically creates a container in the DOM (e.g., as a modal overlay), loads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the feedback widget (`feedback-widget.html`, `feedback-widget.css`, `feedback-widget.js`) into it, and displays it to the user.
3.  **Contextual Data:** The widget automatically collects basic contextual data (URL, user agent) along with the user's feedback.
4.  **Submission & Cleanup:** After the user submits feedback or closes the widget, the dynamically loaded elements are removed from the DOM, returning the website to its original state.

## Integration Steps

1.  **Place Files:**
    *   Create a directory, for example, `your-website/assets/feedback/`.
    *   Place `feedback-integrator.js`, `feedback-widget.html`, `feedback-widget.css`, and `feedback-widget.js` inside this directory.

2.  **Include `feedback-integrator.js`:**
    *   Add the following `<script>` tag to the `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag of your website's HTML, on every page where you want feedback to be available. It's recommended to load it `async` or `defer` to prevent blocking the page render.

    ```html
    <script src="/assets/feedback/feedback-integrator.js" defer></script>
    ```
    *   **Important:** Adjust the `src` path (`/assets/feedback/feedback-integrator.js`) to match where you've placed the file on your server.

3.  **Configure Feedback Endpoint:**
    *   The `feedback-widget.js` currently includes a placeholder for `YOUR_BACKEND_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT`. You *must* replace this with the actual URL of your API endpoint that will receive and process the feedback data (e.g., `/api/feedback`). This endpoint should be set up to handle `POST` requests.

## Triggering the Feedback Widget

There are two primary ways for users to activate the feedback widget:

1.  **Keyboard Shortcut (Recommended for Users):**
    *   Press `Ctrl + Shift + F` (or `Cmd + Shift + F` on Mac).
    *   This is the most non-disruptive method as it requires explicit user intent and doesn't clutter the UI.

2.  **URL Query Parameter (Recommended for Support/Direct Links):**
    *   Append `?_feedback=true` to any page URL.
    *   Example: `https://www.yourwebsite.com/your-page?_feedback=true`
    *   This can be useful if you want to provide a direct link to a user in a support email, or for internal testing, without having a visible "Feedback" button on the site.

## Benefits

*   **Zero UI Impact:** Absolutely no visual changes to your existing website design or layout unless the user actively triggers the feedback widget.
*   **Non-Disruptive:** Users are not interrupted by pop-ups or sticky buttons unless they choose to provide feedback.
*   **Seamless Integration:** The widget appears as a native part of the site, collecting contextual information automatically.
*   **On-Demand:** Feedback is gathered when the user is motivated to provide it, often in specific contexts (e.g., after encountering an issue).
*   **Flexible:** Easily customizable widget content and styling, and the trigger mechanism can be adjusted.

## Customization

*   **Styling:** Modify `feedback-widget.css` to match your brand's look and feel.
*   **Content:** Edit `feedback-widget.html` to change the fields or instructions within the feedback form.
*   **Triggers:** Adjust the `KEY_TRIGGER` and `URL_PARAM_TRIGGER` constants in `feedback-integrator.js` if you prefer different activation methods.
*   **Data Collection:** Extend `feedback-widget.js` to collect more contextual data (e.g., specific element IDs, user session data if available in global JS variables).
